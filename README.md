# Python
I have been taking a certification class in Pyhton coding. These are my projects from the 
first one ever performed to my most recent. They progressively get better and I want to show case 
my ability and progression.
I started out as a beginner never coding before and I want to highlight my drive in the IT world by 
continuing to improve.
